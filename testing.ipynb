This pattern varies slightly between closely related bird species.\\nA popular bird for mummies The falcon is one of the \\nmost commonly found birds in the votive animal mummy record of ancient Egypt. This is likely because many ancient Egyptian gods were depicted with falcon heads, notably Ra and Horus (both gods of the sun and sky).\\xa0\\nMystery missing bandages Some bandages are missing \\naround the tomial tooth (the bump near the tip of the beak). We don’t know whether that was due to erroneous handling of the mummy before its burial, decomposition in the ground after burial, or both.\\xa0\\nWhy does part of the skull cover the falcon's eye? The front of the falcon's eyes is partially covered by a narrow strap-like bone. This bone is the lacrymal, and it likely acts as a sunshade for the falcon as it hunts for prey in the air, often under intense sunlight.\\nThe perching digit The first digit of each foot (named \\nhallux in birds) is so extended that it looks as if the falcon is perched inside the bandages.\",\n",

In a story published in the National Geographic magazine in 2008, zooarcheologist Salima Ikram notes a trend that might not be so surprising to a 21st-century human: the more attractive the bundle, the more likely it is to contain a fake mummy!  \\nThe real ibis mummy and the fake mummy together present an exception to this rule: the wrapping of the real mummy features a beautiful artistic depiction of an ibis, while that of the fake mummy has no decoration at all. \\nDo we know exactly where this mummy was made? We are certain that this pseudo-\\nmummy was purchased by James Ferrier in Thebes alongside the real ibis mummy. However, we don’t know whether it was really made in Thebes despite this town being one of the Nile valley’s major falcon and ibis necropolises.\\xa0\\nHow old is this mummy? We know that this mummy \\nwas produced around 278 BC (2 sigma range 295 to 208 BC) thanks to Carbon 14 dating.
